# TSP-with-Genetic-algorithms

This repository contains a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA). It aims to provide an optimal or near-optimal solution to the TSP by evolving a population of routes over a series of generations.

The repository is created and maintained by [AbderrhmanAbdellatif](https://github.com/AbderrhmanAbdellatif).

## Features

- Efficient genetic algorithm implementation.
- Visualization of the best route across generations.
- Ability to customize parameters like mutation rate, crossover rate, and population size.
- Test datasets provided.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AbderrhmanAbdellatif/TSP-with-Genetic-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd TSP-with-Genetic-algorithms
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Adjust the parameters as needed:
   - `POP_SIZE`: Population size.
   - `ELITE_SIZE`: Number of top routes to retain without mutation.
   - `MUTATION_RATE`: Probability of mutating a route.
   - `GENERATIONS`: Number of generations to evolve.

3. Enjoy the visualization of the best route evolution!
